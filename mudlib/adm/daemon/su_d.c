Usage: <su [player]>

The su command allows you to change into another character, or a fresh
version of your own character. It is equivalent to logging out and logging
back in, but quicker. The most important thing that happens when you su
is that a new copy of the player object is cloned. This is useful if you
have just modified the player object and need to test the changes.
With an argument, su prompts you for the password of the player named
<player> and polymorphs you into that player. If you pass your
own name as argument, su does not ask for the password and you appear as
yourself in a new clone of the player object.
