# /adm/db/groups.db
# from the Nightmare Mudlib
# defines groups of euid's with similar access needs
# system created by Descartes of Borg 01 august 1993
# based on security ideas by Cygnus@Synergy
#
# file format:
# (group name): list of members by euid
# note... a creator's name is the euid for that creator
#
# (admin) and (arch) groups added for future development of the
# security system.
#
# Users: "admin" removed to eliminate security hole
#        "superuser" removed from (superuser) group to eliminate recursion
#
# (superuser) group: Defines the general operations personnel
# that perform the day to day global support or emergency recovery
(god): parnell
(admin): parnell
(superuser): parnell
#
# (assist) group: Defines people who require Arch-Wizard access
# in the performance of bug hunting and/or specific functionality 
(siteadmin): parnell
(assist): parnell
#
# (arch) group: Defines the combined resources of (superuser) and
# the (assist) personnel.  Plans are expected to change this to
# contain (admin) and (assist) eventually to further isolate SU
(arch): (superuser) (assist) parnell
#
# (approval) group: To be honest, this is pretty much unused at this
# time and its functionality in the future is uncertain.
# ZNOTE: Approval removal in favor of mentor expansion unless
# this is a good place to put your QC personnel?
(approval): parnell
#
# DANGER: add people to (mudlib) with extreem care, people in this
# group _potentially_ could su themselves
# ZNOTE: Phase 5 (mudlib) isolation
(mudlib): parnell
#
# (law) group: This is pretty much a "feel" group and its value as
# as security group is worthless...Consider remolding the (law) group
# away from security towards (law) adminstration and as a mail group.
(law): parnell
#-------------------------------------------------------
#  NO NORMAL WIZARD NAME SHOULD APPEAR ABOVE THIS LINE 
# All groups above offer GLOBAL responsibility and privs
#-------------------------------------------------------
# (mentor) group: Defines the people that have demonstrated exceptional
# commitment as builders, educators, and domain adminstration of multiple
# areas.  These people are the ones that keep the younger wizzes in line.
(mentor): parnell
#
# (elder) group: Defines the people that have completed a major build
# project and have established themselves as respectable builders.  This
# is really just a "pat-on-the-back" however since the (mentor) group is
# embedded, this makes a good mail group of the "top builders"
(elder): (mentor)  parnell
#
# (wizard) group: Contains the complete list of all low ranking immortals
# that have yet to distinguish or prove themselves in extraordinary ways
(wizard): parnell
#
# (ambassador) group: Unused at this time (BUT REQUIRED FOR NOW)
(ambassador): parnell
# (advocate) group: Unused at this time (future uncertain)
(advocate): parnell
#-------------------------------------------------------
# DOMAIN GROUPS 
# This area should expect to see significant expansion.
