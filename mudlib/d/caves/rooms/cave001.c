This is a small cave set into the side of a hill.  For years it has been whispered that the entrance to a drow city was located near here.  Of course that has never been proven, anyone who explores the depths vanishes.  Sunlight shines down in thin wispy strands, not really illuminating much as the black walls, floor, and ceiling seem to gobble nearly all light.  A %^BOLD%^%^YELLOW%^HUGE%^RESET%^ sign catches your eye, better read it.
