You stumble into the entrance of a temple.  The walls are adorned with spiders of various sizes, as well as glyphs and sigils.  There are braziers emitting a foul smoke that reminds you of burning flesh.  Here and there is a mutilated corpse of someone foolish enough to come into the caves.  In the center of the room there is a massive statue.
