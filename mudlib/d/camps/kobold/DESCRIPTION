The Kobold Campgrounds     by Duridian, Elder Wizard

----------------------

 

The kobold campgrounds are a newbie/low-level area consisting

of nearly 60 rooms.  This area is the first of several small

areas that will be attached to one another.  The campgrounds

consist of a cluster of rooms in the southwest that house the

kobold families, planting fields to the north of those tents,

a trail that winds through the grounds, soldier tents in the

eastern part of the area, and finally, a circle of tents with

a larger tent (that can be entered) in the northeasternmost

section.  It is in this tent where the kobold chieftain and

his guards live.  There are a few spell casters in the area,

including the chieftain himself.  I included a few nasty

little tricks.  For instance, if a kobold is attacked and a

guard is present, the guard attacks the attacker, and will

follow the attacker if he tries to flee.  If a kobold is

attacked in the chieftain's presence, he either casts a *6

fireball or a *6 lightning bolt at the attacker.  I have not

coded a quest for this area as of yet, but I plan to do so

when I code another area.  This will allow me to connect the

areas together with a story line of some kind.  The area has

about a dozen and a half different monsters and around 20

different weapons and armors to go along.  The next area I

will code will probably consist of a dwarven military base

that will lie to the north of the kobolds.  A possible quest

would involve raiding the kobold area and performing some

sort of task for an important dwarven npc.  I anticipate that

the dwarf area will be a bit larger and quite a bit harder

that the kobold area.  The kobold rooms also have different

descriptions for day and night, since almost the entire area

is outdoors.
