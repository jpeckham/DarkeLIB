Gnomes are among the most magical beings in this reality, although they
are not at all attractive.  Their intelligence and wisdom is nearly
unrivalled, and they are a wee below the norm in strength
and sturdiness.

Physical description:
Gnomes are known for their HUGE ears.  I mean we are not talking just big,
seriously humoungous, which looks damn humourous compared to their physical
size of a little more than a meter.  Many of them wear beards of brown hair,
and they have a leathery, tanned skin.  They also have very hairy feet.
They tend to have freckly noses.
