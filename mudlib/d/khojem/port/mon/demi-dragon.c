     "eyes burn red, and his tail is broad at the base, but quickly "

     "his ears are small and pointed, and his glowing-red eyes reveal "
     "a great intelligence as it measures you as a potential prey.\n\n"
     "Yet, the demi-dragon's wings are greatly depreciated making "
     "flight impossible, he stands erect on his hind legs, and his "
     "forelegs are developed much like a very strong Storm-giant.  "
