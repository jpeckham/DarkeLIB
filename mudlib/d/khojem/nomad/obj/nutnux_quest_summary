  Do directed tells to the Nutnux and include either 
  of these target strings:  "sash"  or "quest"
  example:  say nutnux, I hear you have a quest for me?
  
  The response says he is looking for a lost sash and 
  would be happy if you returned it.
  
Basically, it is a search and find mission since Nutnux
doesn't give you any clues as to where he may have lost
the sash.  Also, the area is filled with a few different
sashs that can be worn as belt armor.  The players should
recover a sash and return it to Nutnux.  Either it is the
right sash or the wrong sash.

Realistically, I doubt if many players below level 15 can
solo this quest unless they got some healing potions.  I 
designed this as a group quest for 12's and 13's.  I figure
a fighter or two with a healer can do it fairly easily.

To find the right sash:

o Go NW from Nutnux in d1 to d9.  
o North from D9 and fall into the sand marsh pit to sp1. 
o Issue a SEARCH SAND.  If your perception skill is high enough
  you will find a sand key. 
o Go north to sp2 and fight the two sand spiders (lvl 9)
  (note: players can avoid the fight and continue to next step, too.)
o Go north to sp3 and fight the king spider (lvl 11)
  (note: players can also avoid this mob, too)
o Discover the hidden door to the east, unlock and open door
o Door opens east to tomb - kill the mummy (lvl 12)
o Issue a SEARCH SAND.  If your perception skill is high enough
  you will discover a trapdoor leading down
o The trapdoor opens to pit
o Kill the sand worm (lvl 13), recover the sash  (it is a pink sash)
o Return to sp3 where the king spider was found
o Issue a SEARCH - discover hidden exit to north
o Hidden one-way exit leads to rv4 and two hyenas (lvl 5)
o Go west to rv3 to and two more hyenas (lvl 5)
o Go up twice to rv1
o Go se twice and return pink quest sash to Nutnux
