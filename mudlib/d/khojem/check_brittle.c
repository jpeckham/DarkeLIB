/*
 * Small file that checks for brittleness of a weapon in a spell.
 * The spell should contian the following AFTER the spell is completed, 
 * but BEFORE any actual enchantments are added.
 *
 * if(!check_brittle(object weap, object caster, int brittle)) {
 *   remove();
 *   return;
 * }
 *
 * weap refers to the weapon receiveing the check.
 * brittle is the amount of 'brittle points' to be added.
 * caster is the caster of the spell (or user of skill).
 * The weapon will automatically be shattered, a message sent to
 * the player, and a 0 returned if the check is unsuccessful, 
 * otherwise, a 1 is returned.
 * NOTE: Armours are not currently supported, though if you add
 * the above code to an armour enchantment, no errors will occur.
 * In fact, this would not be such a bad idea in case we implement
 * armour brittleness in the future.
