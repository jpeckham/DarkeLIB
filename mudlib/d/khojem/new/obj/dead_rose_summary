/wizards/khojem/new/room/hermit_hut.c
  Do directed tells to the hermit and include either 
  of these target strings:  "dead rose"  or "quest"
  example:  say hermit, tell me about this quest?
  
  The response should point you to Fir'burger, king
  of the wood-elves.
  
/wizards/khojem/new/room/gallery.c
  Do directed tells to the king.  Valid keyword phrases are: 
    "dead rose", "faerie", "mage", "hermit", "gnome"
  
  The responses tell you about the whereabouts of the dead rose
  after the king stole it from the hermit.  Now a faerie has it.
  The mage phrase is only to help point players in the right
  direction if they ask him about the mage.  Basically, at this
  point the player shouldn't know which way to turn.
  
/wizards/khojem/new/shop/pub.c
  Do directed tells to the lackey.  Valid keyword phrases are:
    "dead rose", "faerie", "mage", "basement", "trapdoor"
    
  The entire concept of the complex objects in the pub is so
  a player ends up spending time in the pub.  The pub has the
  no attack property set, they can drink, play with Rox'fir the
  elven vixen, and play the slot machine.  All this in hopes 
  that a player will notice the lackey and start talking to him.
  If a language is used that the lackey doesn't understand there
  is a 50% chance the lackey will wakeup and tell you he can't
  understand you from a catch_tell.
  
  After talking to the lackey the player will know:
  
    o the faerie has the quest object
    o the mage keeps the faerie below her hut
    o that the basement must be entered by rapping
       three times with a closed fist on the floor
       
/wizards/khojem/new/room/mage_hut.c
  You could de directed tells to the mage.  Keyword phrases are:
    "dead rose", "faerie", "hermit", "king"
    
  50% percent of the responses from the mage will talk about her
  missing servant and how he is probably drunk.  Hopefully, the
  player will think to look in the pub if he hasn't already.
  
  The player must "rap" on the floor three times.  First word
  must be "rap" and the words "fist" and "floor" must appear.
  example:  rap on floor with fist
  After the third "rap"  a trapdoor exit is added to the room.
  The mage must be killed to exit via the trapdoor.
  
/wizards/khojem/new/room/trap_door.c
  Here the player finds the evil faerie.  There is no talking
  to the faerie.  You kill the faerie and take the rose.
  
/wizards/khojem/new/room/hermit_hut.c
  Return the dead rose to the gnome hermit and player completes
  the quest.
