You have entered the sacred confessional.  A priest may be called
so that you may confess your sins.  You should feel free to honestly
express yourself and pray for your salvation.  Should you feel the
need, a donation box is available for your tithe and a storage locker
is provided for any material offerings you may have. Through a broad
arch-way to the east is the cloister of the Clerics Guild and to the
south a small church owned store.

You feel an unmistakable impression that should you leave any chest
or locker open, all items contained therein would be given unto our God.
