# Configuration file for the MudOS LPmud driver.
#
# This file is intended for use with the Lima Mudlib and its corresponding
# version of the driver.
#
# The current versions are:
#
#    Lima Mudlib:  Lima 1.0b4
#    MudOS:        MudOS v22.2b13

# 951030, Deathblade: updated - reorganized, commented, etc

# Users of Lima:  you should change the following definitions to match
# your desires, needs, and setup.  Simply follow the directions for each
# option and things should work okay.  Each option will be labeled on
# whether it is required to be changed, or if it is optional.  Anything
# that is optional is subject to your discretion.

# [ REQUIRED ]
#
# This will be the name of your mud.

# This will be the port number that your users will connect to

port number : 7878

# if an object is left alone for a certain time, then the

# like destructing the object. If the function isn't defined by the
# object, then nothing will happen.
# This time should be substantially longer than the swapping time.

# How long time until an unused object is swapped out.
# Machine with too many players and too little memory: 900 (15 minutes)

# Machine with infinite memory: 0 (never swap).

# Define the size of the shared string hash table.  This number should
# a prime, probably between 1000 and 30000; if you set it to about 1/5
# of the number of distinct strings you have, you will get a hit ratio
# (number of comparisons to find a string) very close to 1, as found strings
# are automatically moved to the head of a hash chain.  You will never
# need more, and you will still get good results with a smaller table.
hash table size : 7001
 
# Object hash table size.
# Define this like you did with the strings; probably set to about 1/4 of
# the number of objects in a game, as the distribution of accesses to
# objects is somewhat more uniform than that of strings.
object table size : 1501
