       An array of every object loaded on the mud is returned  by
       objects().   Note  that if the system's maximum array size
       is set too low, objects()  will  truncate  its  array,  in
       which case it might not be too useful.

       If the optional `func' and `ob' parameters are given, then
       ob->func() is called with each loaded object as  an  argu-
       ment.   If  the function returns nonzero, then that object
       is returned by objects(), otherwise it isn't.

       If 'f' is given, it will be called on all the  objects  as
       above.   For  example,  objects(  (: clonep :) ) returns a
       list of all the clones in existence.
