       Parse  a  string  `str'  using the format `fmt'. `fmt' can
       contain strings separated by "%d" and "%s". Every "%d" and
       "%s"  corresponds  to  one of `var1', `var2'...  "%d" will
       give a number, and "%s" will give a string.  The * may  be
       used  in  a  format  specifier (e.g. %*d and %*s) to allow
       integers or strings (respectively) to be skipped  over  in
       the  input  string (without being assigned to a variable).
       The LPC sscanf() is similar to its C  counterpart  however
       it  does behave somewhat differently.  It is not necessary
       (or possible) to pass the address of variables into sscanf
       (simply  pass  the name of the variable).  Another differ-
       ence is that in the LPC  sscanf(),  sscanf(str,  "%s  %s",
       str1, str2) will parse the first word in str into str1 and
       the remainder of str into str2.

       The number of matched "%d" and "%s" is returned.
