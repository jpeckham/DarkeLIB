       message()  calls  receive_message(mixed class, string mes-
       sage) in all objects in the target list excluding those in
       the exclude list. This basically tells the object the mes-
       sage.

       Class is the type of message (used for clients and  such).
       An example would be 'combat', 'shout', 'emergency' etc.

       Message is a string containing the text to send.

       Target  is  a list of objects to be sent the message. This
       can be either a single object string or object pointer, or
       may  be an array of either.  If a target is non-living all
       objects in its environment will receive the message.

       Exclude is a list of objects that should not  receive  the
       message.  This  can  either  be  one object or an array of
       objects.
