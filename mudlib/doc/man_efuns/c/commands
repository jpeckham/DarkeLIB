       Returns an array of an array of  4  items  describing  the
       actions  that  are  available to this_object().  The first

       The  second  is  the set of flags (passed to add_action as
       the third argument, often defaulted to 0).  The  third  is
       the  object  that  defined  the action.  The fourth is the
       function to be called ("<function>" if it  is  a  function
       pointer).
