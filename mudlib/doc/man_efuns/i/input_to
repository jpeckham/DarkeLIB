       input_to()  -  causes  next  line of input to be sent to a
       specified function

       Enable  next  line  of  user input to be sent to the local
       function `fun' as an argument. The input line will not  be
       parsed by the driver.

       Note  that  input_to  is non-blocking which means that the
       object calling input_to does not pause waiting for  input.
       Instead  the  object  continues  to execute any statements
       following the input_to.  The specified function `fun' will
       not be called until the user input has been collected.

       If  "input_to()" is called more than once in the same exe-
       cution, only the first call has any effect.

       If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the line given by
       the  player will not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped
       (this is useful for collecting passwords).

       The function `fun' will be called with the user  input  as
       its  first  argument  (a string). Any additional arguments
       supplied to input_to will be passed on to `fun'  as  argu-
       ments following the user input.
