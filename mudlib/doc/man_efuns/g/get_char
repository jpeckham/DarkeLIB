       get_char  - causes next character of input to be sent to a
       specified function

       ... );

       Enable  next  character  of  user  input to be sent to the
       function `fun' as an argument. The  input  character  will
       not be parsed by the driver.

       Note  that  get_char  is non-blocking which means that the
       object calling get_char does not pause waiting for  input.
       Instead  the  object  continues  to execute any statements
       following the get_char.  The specified function `fun' will
       not be called until the user input has been collected.

       If  "get_char()" is called more than once in the same exe-
       cution, only the first call has any effect.

       If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the char given by
       the  player will not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped
       (this is useful for collecting passwords).

       The function `fun' will be called with the user  input  as
       its  first  argument  (a string). Any additional arguments
       supplied to get_char will be passed on to `fun'  as  argu-
       ments following the user input.

BBUUGGSS
       Please  note  that get_char has a significant bug in MudOS
       0.9 and earlier.  On many systems with poor telnet negoti-
       ation  (read:  almost  every major workstation on the mar-
       ket), get_char makes screen output behave  strangely.   It
       is  not recommended for common usage throughout the mudlib
       until that bug is fixed.  (It is currently only  known  to
       work well for users connecting from NeXT computers.)
