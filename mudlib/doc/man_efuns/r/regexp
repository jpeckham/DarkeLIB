       Typically when presented with an array of  lines  of  text
       and  a regular expression, regexp(3) returns an array con-
       taining those lines which match the pattern  specified  by
       the  regular expression. If the flag (default 0) has bit 2
       set, then non-matches will be returned instead of matches.
       If  the flag  has bit 1 set, the array returned will be of
       the form ({ index1 + 1, match1, ..., indexn + 1, matchn })
       where  index1  is  the index of 1st match/non match in the
       array lines.

       A regular expression is zero or more  _b_r_a_n_c_h_e_s,  separated
       by  `|'.   It  matches  anything  that  matches one of the
       branches.

       A branch is zero or more _p_i_e_c_e_s, concatenated.  It matches
       a match for the first, followed by a match for the second,
       etc.

       A piece is an _a_t_o_m possibly followed by `*', `+', or  `?'.
       An  atom  followed  by `*' matches a sequence of 0 or more
       matches of the atom.  An atom followed by  `+'  matches  a
       sequence  of  1 or more matches of the atom.  An atom fol-
       lowed by `?' matches a match of  the  atom,  or  the  null
       string.

       An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a
       match for the regular expression), a  _r_a_n_g_e  (see  below),
       `.'   (matching  any  single character), `^' (matching the
       null string at the beginning of  the  input  string),  `$'
       (matching the null string at the end of the input string),
       a `\' followed by a single character (matching that  char-
       acter),  or  a single character with no other significance
       (matching that character).

       A _r_a_n_g_e is a sequence of characters enclosed in `[]'.   It
       normally  matches  any single character from the sequence.
       If the sequence begins with `^',  it  matches  any  single
       character _n_o_t from the rest of the sequence.  If two char-
       acters in the sequence  are  separated  by  `-',  this  is
       shorthand  for  the  full list of ASCII characters between
       them (e.g. `[0-9]' matches any decimal digit).  To include
       a literal `]' in the sequence, make it the first character

       (following a possible `^').  To  include  a  literal  `-',
       make it the first or last character.

       If a regular expression could match two different parts of
       the input string, it will match the one which begins  ear-
       liest.   If both begin in the same place but match differ-
       ent lengths, or match the same length in  different  ways,
       life gets messier, as follows.

       In  general,  the  possibilities in a list of branches are
       considered in left-to-right order, the  possibilities  for
       `*',  `+',  and  `?'  are considered longest-first, nested
       constructs are considered from the outermost in, and  con-
       catenated  constructs  are considered leftmost-first.  The
       match that will be chosen is the one that uses the  earli-
       est  possibility  in the first choice that has to be made.
       If there is more than one choice, the next will be made in
       the  same  manner  (earliest  possibility)  subject to the
       decision on the first choice.  And so forth.

       For example, `(ab|a)b*c' could match `abc' in one  of  two
       ways.   The  first  choice  is between `ab' and `a'; since
       `ab' is earlier, and does lead  to  a  successful  overall
       match, it is chosen.  Since the `b' is already spoken for,
       the  `b*'  must  match  its  last  possibility--the  empty
       string--since it must respect the earlier choice.

       In the particular case where no `|'s are present and there
       is only one `*', `+', or `?', the net effect is  that  the
       longest  possible  match  will  be chosen.  So `ab*', pre-
       sented with `xabbbby', will match `abbbb'.  Note  that  if
       `ab*'  is  tried  against  `xabyabbbz', it will match `ab'
       just after `x', due  to  the  begins-earliest  rule.   (In
       effect,  the  decision  on where to start the match is the
       first choice to be made,  hence  subsequent  choices  must
       respect  it  even  if  this  leads  them to less-preferred
       alternatives.)
