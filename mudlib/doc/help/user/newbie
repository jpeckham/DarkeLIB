	There is a public ftp site at darke.shadowlands.com
Check in the /pub/player dir.  This handbook and other stuff is in there.

I.Getting Started
	A.Choose a Race:  
	  There are a variety of races on DarkeMUD.  Races get bonuses 
          to stats and get special abilities, i.e. faster healing, 
          ambidexterity, night vision, multiple limbs, etc.  The races 
          are balanced by experience point modifiers.  Some races are 
          very versatile and others are really only suited for particular 
          guilds.  Select a race carefully and make sure it suits the type 
          of guild you wish to join, i.e. an ogre would be a bad choice 
          for a race if you want to be an arch-mage, not to say it's not 
          possible to do it, just very hard...  Here's a selection of 
	  races currently on DarkeMUD:
     ===========================  Races  ================================
       Drow-Elf    Gromek        High-Man       Storm-Giant    Werebear
       Dwarf       Half-Elf      Hill-Giant     Sword-Demon    Weretiger
       Ent         Half-Orc      Ogre           Thranx         Werewolf
       Gerudan     Halfling      Seraph         Troll          Wood-Elf
       Gnome       High-Elf      Sprite         Vulfen         Wraith
     ====================================================================
	  When you look at a race help file it will display everything in a 
	  category.  These are broken down like this:
	  Stats--very low, low, below avg, avg, above avg, high, 
 	  very high, SICK
	  Sight--below avg, avg, above avg, night vision, dark vision
	  HP Regen--avg, above avg, high, SICK, LUDICROUS
	  MP Regen--avg, above avg, high
	  Natural Weaponry--standard = Fist   the ( ) are for how good the 
          weapon class is.
	  Natural Armor--Tough skin is just natural armor   the ( ) are for 
          how good the armor is.
	  Ambidexterity--yes or no
	  Innate Spells/Skills--one, some, or both
	  Exp Modifier--very low, below avg, nil, above avg, high, very high
			 low is a negative exp modifier, high is positive
	  Limbs--Does the race have more than two arms?
	  Magic Resistance--above avg, high
	  Note--Some races have a resistance/allergy, i.e. can take less 
                         damage or more damage, from certain damage types.
			 Ex. Trolls take extra damage from fire attacks.  
                         Werewolves take less damage from mundane weapons.

	B.Choose a Guild:
	  There are many guilds in DarkeMUD.  Guilds are a very important 
          part DarkeMUD.  First, guild unity is very big.  Guild members 
          look out for each other.  There will be a guildmaster and guild 
          representatives.  You can join a guild by going to the location 
          of the guild, and if the guildmaster is there and a mob just 
          type: 
			 say guildmaster, join
	  If the guildmaster tells you that you may now join, just type: 
			 join
	  Some guilds lean towards partying and some towards soloing.  
          Try to  match your guild with your race as noted above.
		  Guilds are where you learn skills and spells by spending 
	  development points.  Guilds also determine how many hit points and 
	  magic points you get and how fast you regenerate those.  Here is
          a list of guilds:
    =============================  Guilds  ==============================
    Warriors         Cleric          Mage              Semi-Spell Users
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Thief +          Cleric +        Arch-Mage +       Nightblade +
    Fighter +        War-Priest +    Necromancer +     Chaotic-Lords +
    Cavalier *                       Elementalist +    Druid *
    Tinker +                         Enchanter +       Elemental-Warrior *
    Warrior-Monk #                   Moon-Mage *       Monk *
    Barbarian *                                        Paladin +
							 Sword-Mage +
							 Ranger *
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    * These guilds will not be opening for a while and may not have help 
      files.
    + These guilds are up and running.
    # These guilds are planned for the near future 
    ======================================================================
	 For more detailed information on each guild just type:
			 help <guild>

	C.Stats:
	  There are six stats -- Dexterity, Strength, Constitution, 
          Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  Stat scores range from 
          1-110.  Stats are later modified by racial bonuses and minuses. 
          Later on you can have stats modified by items, quest points 
          and other things.  Your stats will determine how many development 
          points you get(not modified by racial bonuses).  Charisma does 
          not give you any dev points and is generally an unimportant stat.
          (Put your worst stat there)  Stats also give bonuses to skills 
          and are considered the base.  To look at your stats during the 
          game, type: stats
          NOTE: There is no suicide command because players would abuse it
                to get better stats.  BUT you can ask an arch to delete you
                if your stats really suck.

II.Combat System
	Combat in DarkeMUD is both entertaining and deadly.  It will require 
	getting used to before you can go up against powerful monsters 
        without fear of instant death.  At its most basic level, combat 
        consists of 2 second turns in which every participant in combat 
        gets a chance to hit.  How many hits you get depends on several 
        things like how good your weapon or melee skill is, if you have a 
        skill that gives you extra attacks (like whirlwind attack) or how 
        many weapons you can wield simultaneously (like with the skill 
        dual wield).  Combat takes place automatically, and the only way 
        to end it is to flee.  You may flee manually by typing a direction 
        command (n,s,e,w,etc.) to get out of the room, or you may set
        yourself to flee automatically if your hit points are low by 
        setting your wimpy on.  For more on wimpy commands type: help wimpy
	Be careful, some monsters will attack on sight!

	A.Initiating Combat
	  You may start combat with any monster or player by typing: kill 
	  <creature/player>.  Note that once you attack something, you will
	  ALWAYS attack each other on sight until one of you dies, logs off,
	  or both players type stop hunting.(Monsters will not stop)

	B.To Hit Chance
	  Of course, in order to damage your opponent, you must hit him or 
          her.  Your chance of doing so depends on a number of factors:
	  a.Your skill with the weapon(s) -- using a weapon with which you 
            have no skill incurs a LARGE penalty.  NOTE that if you
            have greater that 100% skill in a particular weapon, you
            may gain random bonuses during combat (extra damage, extra
            attacks, etc.).
	  b.The hand in which you wield the weapon...unless your race is 
	    ambidextrous, you hit better with the limb you favor.  To find 
            out which hand you favor type: score
	  c.How many weapons you are wielding.  Wielding more than one weapon
	    also incurs a large penalty, though you may attack with both at 
            once.
	  d.How well you can see in the room.  If you don't seem to be 
            hitting well, light a torch a few torches, or cast a light 
            spell.  Races with dark vision don't need to worry about how 
            much light is in a room.
	  e.Your attack skill.  All guilds get this skill.  This skill 
            determines your base chance to hit with any weapon or in melee 
            combat.  All of the above are modifiers to this chance to hit.
	  Note: Certain higher-level skills can offset the penalties for 
	    attacking with multiple or offhand weapons(offhand training, 
            dual attack, etc.).

	C.Hit Points and Damage
	  Every player and monster has a certain amount of hit points (hp), 
          of which they must be deprived if they are to die.  In addition, 
          every living thing has a body, and certain limbs may take damage 
          and be severed.  The effects of severed limbs depends on the 
          limb... you may not fly without wings, fight without arms, etc.  
          If you get a limb severed and you're not a troll go to the 
          hospital.  It's right next to the church.  The hospital can 
          restore lost limbs, cleanse poison, and even transfuse blood...
          all for a price of course.  There are also several other ways to 
          die without having your hp reduced to 0, and, perhaps even worse, 
          several ways to have your hp reduced by a great amount in one 
          blow!
	    The amount of damage you do in combat is based on your weapon 
          and how good it is.  Certain skills are capable of ascertaining
          the quality of  weapons.  Most of the time, you can expect not to 
          have more than 10 pts of damage done to you even on a good hit, 
          but there are SEVERAL exceptions.  If you are attacking 
          bare-handed, damage is based only on your strength, melee skill, 
          and martial arts skill, if any.
	    Damage may be prevented by armor.  Armor is necessary if you 
          wish to fight difficult monsters without instantly slain.  
          Several different types of armor are available, all with 
          different merits.  Most of them are pretty self-explanatory, for 
          instance, leather armor is great against cutting wpns but watch 
          out for clubs and maces.  Plate is good against most weapons, 
          but electrical spells can still rock your world.  Several spells 
          also provide protection against damage.

	D.Critical Hits
	  The better a weapon is and the better your skill with it, the 
	  greater the chance of incurring a critical hit.  The results of 
          the critical hit depend on the weapon you are using (or melee and 
          martial arts skill if no weapon), your skill with that weapon, 
          and your opponent's armor.  For instance blunt weapons often stun 
          opponents, while cutting weapons tend to lacerate and sometimes 
          even lop off limbs.  On extremely rare occasions, critical hits 
          can kill outright!  They can also do continuing damage, 
          temporarily lower stats and combat skills, or stun you.(Stun is 
          nasty!)  You will notice that this is not so rare if you try to 
          attack a powerful monster with no armor!
	    Basically, the critical hit system is a large part of what 
          makes combat on DarkeMUD so colorful.  There are probably upwards 
          of several thousand possible critical hit results with more on 
          the way.  
	  
	E.Thrown Weapons
	  Some weapons (knives, daggers, and hand axes) may be thrown.  To 
          do so, just type:  throw <weapon> at <target>
	  You lose the weapon by doing so, but hits inflict much more damage 
          than just wielding the weapon, and there is a greater chance of 
          inflicting a critical hit.
	    Note:  As of this writing, bows are not available, though the 
            skill is available.  Bows will be instituted later on down the 
            road.
	
	F.Food and Drink
	  By the way, food and drink drastically improve your character's hp
          and mp regeneration rate!  Every good adventurer should carry 
          around lots of rations and one waterskin (waterskins can be 
          bought at the cleric's guild).  Fill waterskins at vats of water, 
          in streams, at fountains, etc. (just type:fill waterskin).
          Also, try the tavern on the west side of town.  Clerics and
          some other guilds get 'herb lore' skill which allows the
          distilling of a potion from the grass of the DarkeMUD
          plains.  This allows a great increase to mp regeneration for
          a short period, but also can interfere with spell casting.

        G.Experience
          Combat is the major source of experience on this mud.  However, you
          do not get the experience instantly with the kill.  Read the
          chapter on Experience (IV) further down in this document.

III.Spell System
  DarkeMUD has a very complex system of spellcasting with many spells 
  available to players throughout the variety of guilds.  The system itself
  is quite simple on the surface.  A player learns a spell much like they 
  would learn a skill through training and spending development points.  
  The player may learn the spell at power level 1 through 6, with each 
  successive level being more costly.  Upon casting a spell, the player 
  may choose the power level at which to cast it, with a maximum of the 
  level known by the player.  The power level multiplies both the mp 
  (magic point) cost of the spell and its effects, allowing the player to 
  tailor the power of the spell to the situation.  You will become very 
  familiar with the alias command if you are a spellcaster of any kind!  
  The effect of increasing spell power varies from spell to spell, but in 
  general; spell duration is increasesd, more effective, and harder to 
  resist at higher power.

  A.Learning Spells
    Spells are learned at the player's guild, obviously meaning you must 
    join a guild before you can learn spells.  With the permission of the 
    guildmaster, you may learn spells at other guilds, at increased cost.
    Spells are learned by power levels, which range from 1 to 6.  You may
    find the development cost of a spell by typing: help spell <spell name>
    The cost of training a spell is the development cost times the level 
    you wish to attain.  If you have developed it once already at your 
    level, the cost is equal to the fast development cost times the level.  
    If you wish to train more than twice in a level, the cost is 
    cumulative.  For example, the spell Cure Light Wounds has a 
    development cost of 7 and a fast development cost of 25. 
    
    Train:         Cost:
    Once           7 (7 x power level 1)
    Twice          50 (25 x power level 2)
    Thrice         150 [(25 + 25) x power level 3]
    Four times     300 [(25 + 25 + 25) x power level 4]
    etc...

    Keep in mind that once you advance a level, you start over at the 
    regular development cost... for example:

    Train:         Cost:
    Once           7 (7 x power level 1)
    Twice          50 (25 x power level 2)

    And then you go up a level...

    Train:         Cost:
    Once           21 (7 x power level 3)
    Twice          100 (25 x power level 4)
    etc...

    ...meaning it is more efficient to train slowly.

  B.Spell Casting Skills
    The spell power level only determines the maximum power level at which 
    you may cast a spell and has nothing to do with your chance of success 
    in spellcasting.  This is determined by the spell casting skill.  To 
    see which skill is necessary for a spell, type: help spell <spell name>
    If you do not have the necessary skill, you will not be able to cast a
    spell.
	 At its most basic level, the skill in casting represents a percent 
    chance that you will succeed in casting at any particular time.  Note
    that you have a 4% chance of fumbling a spell and decreases as you 
    advance the skill.  Spell casting skills are trained similarly to any 
    other skill and are usually quite costly.  Oh, the price of power!
         Also, if you have a spell casting skill higher that 100%, you
    may gain random bonuses upon casting, including reduced mp cost,
    power boost (power can be increased BEYOND 6 this way), or less
    casting time (even an instant cast).
  
  C.Fumbling a Spell
    There is always a 4% chance of fumbling, but this chance decreases as
    your spell casting skill raises.  The effects of the fumble vary with 
    the spell itself... combat spells go off at a random target, area 
    spells hit people in your party by accident, heal spells harm 
    instead, etc.  Basically this is here to keep you on your toes and to 
    counterbalance the power of spellcasting guilds against the 
    combat-oriented guilds.  No matter what, there is always at least a 1%
    chance of fumbling.

  D.Casting Spells
    Casting spells is accomplished by using the cast command. While casting
    the spell, you supply the target (if necessary) and the power level. 
    Note that you cannot cast a spell at a power level greater than the one
    at which you know it.  For example, if you want to cast the magic 
    missile spell at a snowman at power level 4, you would type:
	   cast *4 magic missile at snowman
    To bind a demon to a sword:
	   cast *5 demon sword at demon with sword
    To cast a blizzard (area effect attack spell)
	   cast *5 blizzard

    1.Ok, while we're here, let's talk about the alias command, which is 
         very helpful for spellcasters and everyone else in general.  The 
         alias command sets up shortcut keystrokes for executing certain 
         other commands.  For example, when you type: n  You go north.  
         N is an alias for north.  In the above example the mage could use 
         alias like this:
			 alias mm cast *4 magic missile at $*
	 By doing this, the player can cast his magic missile spell at power 
	 level 4 at the snowman by just typing:
			 mm snowman
	 $* is a variable for anything that comes after the initial command.
	 Another example of alias command use is for chat channels.  All 
         newbies have access to the newbie channel.  Normally, to talk on 
         the newbie channel, you would type:
			 newbie <message>
	 But with the alias command we can cut down on typing by declaring 
         an alias for the newbie channel.  For example:
			 alias new newbie $*
	 Now, to talk on the newbie channel, all you have to type is:
			 new <message>
	 Another example: To get coins from a corpse, you normally type:
			 get coins from corpse
	 Now, set up the alias for it like this:
			 alias gcc get coins from corpse
	 Now, all you have to do is type: gcc
	 Alias command also makes you more effective in combat at those 
         higher levels when you have commands that can only be used once 
         every two turns (like shield bash for fighters).
	   To view all current aliases that you have type: alias
	   To check an alias type: alias <alias you are checking>
	   To remove an alias type: unalias <alias you are removing>

	 Here are a couple of more complex aliases.
	   alias kk alias k kill $*
		Ex:  alias kk alias k kill drizzt
			Now just type k to kill drizzt
	   alias mm alias m cast *4 magic missile at $*
		Ex:  alias mm alias m cast *4 magic missile at drizzt
			Now just type m to fire a magic missile at drizzt
    
				 ++Drizzt - What can I say... I am lazy.

    2.While you are casting a spell you cannot attack, unless you have the
	 concentrate skill which semi and spell casting guilds have it.  
         Once the spell goes off, the effects (whatever they may be) are 
         resolved.  If you fail the spell, you still lose HALF of the magic 
         points (mp) equal to the power level of the spell times the base 
         mp cost.  Note that if you move while you are in the middle of 
         casting a spell, the spell is interrupted, or there is no target 
         you suffer no mp loss.

    3.Silent Casting and Move While Casting
	 If you know a casting skill for a particular spell at 75% or more, 
         you may cast that spell silently.  When you begin casting the 
         spell, only sorcerers with the spell sense skill will be able to
         tell if you are casting.  Others will be completely blind to the 
         casting, allowing you to surprise them.
	   If you know a casting skill for a particular spell at 90% or 
         more, you may move while casting.  Basically, after you begin 
         casting a spell, you may move freely about (if you make your
         move while casting roll) until the spell goes off.  At 90%
         skill, you have approximately a 60% chance of disrupting a
         spell each time you move.  This chance decreases as you
         train your casting skill past 90%.
         
    4.Resisting a Spell
	 Certain (in fact, most) spells may be resisted.  In some cases, 
	 resisting a spell means that you suffer no effects at all, while 
         in some cases, the effects are merely reduced.  The chance of 
         resisting a spell depends on the target's stats.  Higher 
         constitution, intelligence, and wisdom help particularly.  Also, 
         certain races can have some magical resistance.

    5.Summoning Spells
	 Certain spells summon creatures which you then control.  These 
         include undead, elementals, and demons.  These are 'pets'.  
         They can become quite powerful.  Type: 'help pet' for more info.

IV. Experience
    You gain experience from fighting.  However, on DarkeMud, it takes a
    while for you to learn from your encounter with a monster.  The score
    command displays your mind status (clear, almost clear, clouded, etc.).
    As you kill a monster, the experience is accumulated in your mind,
    sort of "filling it up."  Your real, permanent experience will increase
    slowly, as you "learn from the fight."  This has the following effects:
        1.  You might see your real experience increase for some time
              after a fight.
        2.  If your mind is full of facts, you will stop getting experience
              from killing monsters, and you must wait a while for your mind 
              to clear.
        3.  You might have to wait a little for the last bits of experience
              to be processed before you level, even if you have killed
              enough monsters to advance.
     Note:  Your mind capacity (the amount of experience it can store and
     process) depends on your level ONLY.

V.Skills and Development Points
   Development points are gained by stats except for charisma.  The higher
   the stat, the more dev points you get.  Each level, you get more dev 
   points, and you can also be awarded bonus dev points between levels for
   combat criticals.  There are two ways to spend dev points:
	   1.Slow development: It is a base cost for a skill which you can
		raise once per level; slow but cost-effiecient.
	   2.Fast development: This costs basically double slow dev.  You 
                can fast develop a skill as much as you want as long as you 
                have the dev points to spend on it.  The development costs 
                for skills area flat rate.  Follow this chart.  So until 
                you hit 30% in the skill, each time you raise it, it goes 
                up by 5%. 
                Up to 30%
                  increase by 5%
		31% to 49%
		  increase by 3%
		50% to 69%
		  increase by 2%
		70% on up
		  increase by 1%
		Cost doubles after 90%
		
	MULTI-CLASSING!
	---------------
	     Many MUD's allow multi-classing, ie, the selection of
	more than one guild for the purpose of diversifying your
	character.  As an alternative to this, DarkeMUD has a system
	of "custom multi-classing" which allows the character to
	CUSTOMIZE his or her second class.  It works like this...
	     In town, there is an adventurer's guild.  In order to
	maintain the favor of the DemiUrge, all of the guilds have
	donated both material and manpower to the common goal of
	strengthening the characters of DarkeMUD.  The workers and
	trainers of the Guild are then relieved of all ties of loyalty
	to their guild and teach others as their profession.  As a
	character, you may NOT join the Guild and teach, but you
	MAY learn there.
	     You may chose to 'specialize' in certain skills and
	spells.  See 'help specialize'.  As you advance levels, you
	gain an amount of specialization points equal to half the
	level you are advancing TO, rounding down.  For example, you
	get 1 point advancing to level 2 and 3, 2 to level 4 and 5, 
	etc...  In order to specialize in a skill or spell, you must
        spend an amount of specialization points equal to one and a
	half (1.5) times the level of the skill or spell, rounding UP.
	For example, cure light wounds, a level 1 spell, would cost
        only 2 points, but summon elemental dragon, a level 20 spell,
	would cost 30 points!  Type 'specialize' to see how many
	specialization points you have.  Once you have 'specialize'-ed
	in a skill or spell, you may train it for only 4x cost!
	     I know what you are thinking.  "That is fine for spells,
	but skills don't have a level...that depends on the guild!"
	Well, you are right, but I have come up with this handy
	formula to figure out skill level:
		(dev cost + fast dev cost/2) / 4
	Remember that you may only cross-train at your level MINUS 19.


VI.DEATH
   On DarkeMUD, death is relatively common, so the penalties are not 
   terribly severe.  No permanent damage is done to your character unless 
   you are killed by another player (in which case you can lose points 
   off your skills).
	Normally, when you die, you lose an amount of experience points 
   equal to roughly 1/3 the amount you need to get to the next level.
   Note that the amount is LESS if you are resurrected quickly and
   increases as time passes up to a maximum.  The maximum is reached
   10-20 REAL minutes after death.  If your corpse decays, you quit
   (actually 'quit', not drop link) before being resurrected or
   praying, or the mud reboots before you are revived, the penalty is
   roughly doubled.  Certain spells, namely resurrect and soul gate,
   can greatly reduce the exp penalty incurred by death.

VII.The LAW 
  The law is run by players.  Wizards do not interfere.  There is a council
  of the guildmasters.  They enforce the law through the guilds.  If a guy
  gets out of hand as a player killer, players will be expected to take of
  the matter themselves.  Note: Player killing is allowed on this mud!  
  Anyone can kill whomever they please without the wizzes getting involved.
  The guilds are expected to provide support for their members.  If a low
  level player in your guild is getting killed or stolen from or whatever,
  you are expected to interven on his/her behalf, or face the wrath of the
  guildmaster.  Because of this, the wizzes do not like whining.  If you 
  whine about how hard a time you are having, you will get one of the 
  following responses:
    1.Talk to your guildmaster
    2.Play an easier mud
  However, if your guildmaster is either consistently unavailable or 
  refuses to do his/her job effectively, then there will probably be a new 
  guildmaster.  At present, there is not method of guildmaster
  succession, but soon there will be way(s) of challenging your
  guildmaster or of the guildmaster peacefully stepping down.

Ok, that's the basic stuff.  Now for actual playing I have made a list of 
available player commands and what they do and how to use them.

I.Character Commands:
  A.Body Command
    syntax: body
	 This is a status of the damage done to your limbs.  This is not 
    like hp!!!  The larger the damage value, the worse shape you are in.  
    After combat, type this command to make sure you are not missing any 
    limbs or have any crippled limbs!  If you are wielding your sword in 
    your right hand and your right hand turns out to be crippled, you will 
    have to wait until you heal enough to use it again!
  
  B.Describe Command
    syntax: describe <your description here>
	 Adds a description that people will see when they look at you.  
    The description is shown in the form of "<your name> + 
    <your description>"  If you just type describe, your description is 
    erased.  Since this mud stresses role-playing, be creative and enter a 
    description.  That way, you can add some atmosphere to the mud and this 
    may help you to get into character.

  C.Protection Command
    syntax: protection
            protection limb
         Displays how well protected you are.  "Protection" displays how
    well you would fare against different types of damage (i.e. fire,
    disruption, cutting, etc.).  "Protection Limb" shows how well each part
    of your body is protected.

II.Communication Commands:
  A.Languages Command
    syntax: languages
	 This command tells you all the languages you can speak.  Common 
    is, of course, the universal language, though not everyone is fluent 
    in it.  This can create some interesting conversations.

  B.Mail Command
    syntax: mail <player>
	 This command allows you to send mail to another player on DarkeMUD. 
    This can only be done in the Post Office underneath the church.  You 
    can also read your mail there.

  C.Nickname Command
    syntax: nickname <nickname> <real name>
	 Nickname will substitute real name for all occurrences of nick name 
    on your command line (except for the first word).  This allows you to 
    use shortened words to refer to people, object, etc, rather than typing 
    long drawn out names.  We'll use my name (Glorfindel) as an example.
	   nickname glor glorfindel
    This would allow you to type just glor when talking to me.
    To remove a nickname, just type:
	    unnickname <nickname>
    To remove all nicknames, just type:
	   nickname reset
    To list all your current nicknames, just type:
	   nickname

  D.Say Command
    syntax: say <message>
    syntax: ' <message>
	 Ok, this command is very important on DarkeMUD.  This command 
    allows you to interact with the mobs and players, especially mobs.  
    If you go into a shop, you can normally just type:
	   say shopkeeper, help
    And the shopkeeper will respond to you with a list of commands, 
    usually.  This is especially helpful, if you want to buy, sell, or 
    appraise something.  Here are some examples:
	 To buy something: say shopkeeper, offer 65 gold for rich rations
				  say shopkeeper, offer 37 copper for torch
	 To sell something: say shopkeeper, sell ice sword
			  	  say shopkeeper, sell chain
	 To appraise an item: say shopkeeper, appraise helm
			          say shopkeeper, appraise shield
	 To get a list: say shopkeeper, list

    Not all these commands work with all shopkeepers.  Some shops do not 
    buy items back from players.  If the shopkeeper doesn't respond, 
    try speaking in common.  Some shopkeepers do understand languages 
    other than common.  Shopkeepers are not the only mobs you will need to 
    speak to.  Think carefully and try using key words, for example:
			 say <mob>, <key word>


  E.Speak Command
    syntax: speak <language>
	 This command allows you to speak any one of the languages that you 
    currently know.  

  F.Tell Command
    syntax: tell <player/mob> <message>
	 Tells are telepathic communications that bypass the language 
    barrier, allowing you to speak with players and mobs.  Tells cost you 
    magic points to use so be careful when you use this command.

  G.Reply Command
    syntax: reply <message>
	 This allows you to send a reply 'tell' to the last person that 
    sent a 'tell' to you.  For example:
			Glorfindel tells you: Beware greater demon is loose 
                        in city!
			reply Thanks for the warning!
	 Remember that replies are a form of 'tell' so these cost you mps 
         too!

  H.Yell Command
    syntax: yell <message>
	 This sends a message to surrounding rooms.  The sound does 
    dissipate over distance, however.  This also costs mps to do.

  I.Shout Command
    syntax: shout <message>
	 Sends a telepathic shout to the entire mud.  This costs quite a 
    bit of mps unless you have the telepathy skill like gerudans.  Don't 
    abuse this command.  No shouts about leveling or lag.  Thank you.

  J.Channels
	You have about 2 or 3 channels available to you at any one time.  
	Talking on these channels does not cost you mps!  These are usually
	out of character chat channels.  At levels 1-3 you get newbie 
        channel.  From levels 4+ you have darke channel.  To talk on a 
        channel:
	   newbie <message>
	   darke <message>
	Note I would set up alias commands for your chat channels.
	You also have a guild channel, just type:
	   <guild name> <message>
	You can also have a group or party channel.  To talk on those:
	   party line <message>
	
III.Combat Commands
  A.Kill Command
    syntax: kill <player/mob>
	 This command is fairly well self-explanatory.  You use this command
    to attempt to beat the snot out of something.  For example:
	   kill snotling

  B.Wimpy Command
    syntax: wimpy [on/off]
	 This command toggles whether your wimpy mode is on or off.  If it 
    is on, you will flee after taking a certain amount of damage.  If it is 
    off you will only flee when you manually type a direction to flee.  
    Note you will flee in a random direction if your wimpy is on...unless 
    you set a direction with the next command... 

  C.Wimpydir Command
    syntax: wimpydir <direction>
	 This command allows you to determine in which direction you will 
    go, when you flee.  For example: if you type 
	   wimpydir n
    Your character will go north, if possible, when you flee.

  D.Party Commands
    syntax: party form <name>
		  party add <player>
		  party join <name>
		  party remove <player>
		  party leave
		  party list
		  party line <message>
		  party leader <player>
	 This command accesses the various party enabling functions.  The 
    person who forms any party is automatically the leader of the party.  
    Only that player may add or remove players.  That player may also 
    designate another player as the party leader.  Any party member may 
    leave the party at any time through the <party leave> function.  A list 
    of all current members is given by the <party list> command, it also 
    tells you the levels of party members and their hp and mp status.  
    Experience is awarded based on the individual's level with respect to 
    the rest of the party.  
  
IV.Control Commands:
  A.Alias Command
    syntax: alias                       view current aliases
	     alias <alias> <command>  Set the verb alias to execute command
	     alias <alias>               check the value of <alias>
	 Substitution variables that exist are:
	   $# - Where # is the number of the word after the verb to sub.
	   $* - Will be substituted with everything after the verb.

  B.Unalias Command
    syntax: unalias <alias>
	 Removes an alias value.

V.Handling Commands:
  A.Get Command
    syntax: get <item/all>
	 This command will have your character try to pick up the item 
    specified or if all is typed, it will make your character try to pick 
    up everything in the room.  Some examples:
	   get all
	   get sword
	   get coins
	   get 500 copper from pile 2

  B.Give Command
    syntax: give <item> to <player/mob>
	 This command will make your character give an item in your 
    inventory to the player/mob specified.  You must be in the same room 
    for this to occur.  Some examples:
	   give shield to drizzt
	   give 5000 platinum to drizzt

  C.Drop Command
    syntax: drop <item/all>
	 This command will make your character drop an item in your 
    inventory, or if all is typed, it will make your character drop all 
    items carried.  NOTE: The mud has an auto-clean feature.  This updates
    rooms every 5 MIN!!!  So, don't leave stuff on the ground for a long
    time.  This helps keep the memory down.

  D.Inventory Command
    syntax: inventory
	 This command will display all items in your inventory and whether 
    an item is worn or not.  Shortened command version: i

VI.Information Commands:
  A.Biography Command

	 This command gives some details about your character's life.  
    Shortened command version: bio

  B.Finger Command
    syntax: finger <player>
	 Gives you information about the player named.  Only gives you 
    relative level and race.  You can also see their character description 
    with this command.

  C.Who Command
    syntax: who [-o:<order> <race1> <race2>...]
	 Lists all interactive users who belong to the races supplied, 
    or all users if no races are supplied.
    <order> may be a,b,d,k,l,p,q, or t.   These mean:
    a - sort by name                b - sort by birth date
    d - sort by deaths              k - sort by kills
    l - sort by level(default)      p - sort by playing time
    q - sort by quests              t - sort by login time

    The -def:<default-who> specifier changes your default who.
    Ex: who -def:line    makes your default who mode 'who -line'
    With the -line specifier who will list users by name, position, 
    relative level and location on the mud
    With the -short specifier who will list names of users logged on.
    With the -normal specifier will change your who to normal if your 
    defaultwas different.

    those change.  "Status off" turns off the status report.  Having this
    on is good.  "Status" displays hp, mp, and experience, once.

    There is no syntax command for this, you just ask a wiz, arch, or god
    to suicide you and you get to start all over.  You don't keep exp, 
    quest points or anything, completely start over!  Be careful, don't 
    ask for a suicide unless you really want one!

  G.Reincarnation Command
    There is no syntax for this command, you just ask a wiz, arch, or god
    to reincarnate you.  Lose half you levels.
    You get new stats, get to pick a new race, a new guild, quest points. 
    Make sure this is what you want to do!
    People who can reincarnate:  Diewarzau, Drizzt, Mikus, Warsyn, Khojem, Duridian

Ok, now some playing tips and other miscellaneous stuff:
I.You appear in the church.  Look at the world map and the city map to get 
  your bearings.  Probably be handy to have a pencil and pad near you to 
  write important stuff down, like the coordinates of the city of Akkad.
  Figure out where your guild is and go there and join the guild, see above
  documentation on how to do that.  Explore your guild.  Find the treasury.
  It costs 5 gold per level to enter the treasurey.  All newbies will be
  given some money when they join a guild.  Type: money  Ok, now go train
  your skills.  While you are training, if there is a skill that you don't
  understand what it does exactly, type: help skill <skill name>   Once you
  are done training, yoy need to get armor and a weapon.  Go to the weapon
  shop and the armor shop and pick up stuff that you want your character
  to wear, be careful though, your character can only carry so much
  (determined by Strength stat)!  Now that you have armor and a weapon or
  two, you have to 'wear' your armor:
	wear helm
	wear cloak
	wear bracer on right arm
	wear bracer 2 on left arm
  Now, wield your weapon in the hand that you favor:
	wield longsword in right hand
	wield two handed sword in left hand and right hand
  Now, go to Slim's.  That's the Adventurer's Shop.  Buy food and a torch 
  or  two if its night time (check time by typing: time   or type: look at 
  sky).  While you are at Slim's (Adventurer's Shop) buy a sextant.  Look 
  at the sextant by typing: exa sextant   The description will tell you 
  how to use it.
  All right, now you are ready!  If you are a mage or spellcaster of any 
  sort, it may be a good idea to party with a warrior type player, so that
  way you don't get the snot beat out of you by jackrabbit in the plains!
  As a newbie there are a few places for you to go (though more will come 
  up as time goes by, so check with other newbies on your newbie channel 
  to see if there are some new ones that I haven't mentioned here).  

      - Fir'nvillee (6s, 1w of Akkad, then take the path).
      - Goblin Town (4n, 5w of Akkad, then take the road).
      - Undead Grounds (3n, 10w of Akkad).
      - Ash Mountain (7n, 18e of Akkad, then take the pass).

  While in these areas, do not attack everything you see.  Some of
  the monsters are not for 1st level players.  When possible, use your 
  consider skill to find out how tough a mob is.  To do this type: use 
  consider at goblin  The skill then will tell you how you compare to the 
  mob.  The consider skill can be learned at your guild, all guilds have 
  this skill.  Most of the zones are designed with parties in mind.  So 
  remember that.  If you decide to wander around the continent, like I did, 
  run away from will'o-wisps.  If you see a demon...flee, especially if 
  you heard someone shout "Demon-lord on the loose in city" or something 
  like that.  Ok, I don't want to spoil everything for you so this all the 
  tips you are going to get from me...BTW, if you attempt a quest, do NOT 
  ask another player, wiz, arch, or god anything about them.  They are 
  meant to be puzzling.  
  Ohh yea, if you are bugging and nothing seems to work.  Quit and come 
  back before you ask a wiz.  85% of the time this works.
  If anything was left out... please mail drizzt.
  Above all, have fun.  Good luck!  See ya on the Darke Side!
