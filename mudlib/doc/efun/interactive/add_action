       add_action() - bind a command verb to a local function

       void  add_action( string | function fun, string | string *
       cmd, int flag );

       Set up a local function <fun> to be called when user input
       matches  the  command  <cmd>. Functions called by a player
       command will get the arguments as a string. It  must  then
       return 0 if it was the wrong command, otherwise 1.

       If  the second argument is an array, then all the commands
       in the array will call the second function.  It is  possi-
       ble  to  find  out  which command called the function with
       query_verb().

       If it was the wrong  command,  the  parser  will  continue
       searching  for  another command, until one returns true or
       give error message to player.

       Usually add_action() is called only from  an  init()  rou-
       tine.  The object that defines commands must be present to
       the player, either being the player, being carried by  the
       player,  being  the  room  around  the player, or being an
       object in the same room as the player.

       If argument <flag> is 1, then only the leading  characters
       of  the command has to match the verb <cmd> and the entire
       verb is returned by query_verb().  If argument  <flag>  is
       2, then again, only the leading characters must match, but
       query_verb() will only  return  the  characters  following
       <cmd>.
