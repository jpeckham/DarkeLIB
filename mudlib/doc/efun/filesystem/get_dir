       If `dir' is a filename ('*' and  '?'  wildcards  are  sup-
       ported),  an  array  of strings is returned containing all
       filenames that match the specification.   If  `dir'  is  a
       directory  name  (ending with a slash--ie: "/u/", "/adm/",
       etc), all filenames in that directory are returned.

       If called with a second argument equal to -1, get_dir will
       return  an  array  of  subarrays, where the format of each
       subarray is:

                ({ filename, size_of_file, last_time_file_touched
              })

       Where  filename  is a string and last_time_file_touched is
       an integer being number of seconds since January  1,  1970
       (same format as time(3)).  The size_of_file element is the
       same value that is returned by file_size(3); the  size  of
       the file in bytes, or -2 if it's a directory.
